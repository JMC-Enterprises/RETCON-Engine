# External DLLs
## Why?
This directory is here to back up external DLLs like "glfw3.dll" in-case they get removed from a build folder with no provided back-up.

## glfw3.dll
This DLL is the pre-compiled GLFW binary for x64 Windows Machines. The DLL is taken out of the ``lib-vc2019`` folder.

## libRETCON_GLFW.dll
This DLL is a custom GLFW DLL built by the RETCON team. It's currently closed-source due to some issues with CMake
